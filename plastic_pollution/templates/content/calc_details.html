    <h4>Details of calculations:</h4>
    <p>The jupyter notebook for our analyses is included in the <a href="https://github.com/royanin/plastic_waste" target="_blank">Github repository</a>, along with the data and the website code. We describe below how we did our calculations.</p><br>
<div>    
    <h5>The amount of plastic entering the ocean each year:</h5>
    <p>Jambeck <em>et al.</em> calculated that between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tons (MT or tonnes) of plastic waste enters the ocean each year. A commonly stated value for the current influx is 8 million MT/year, around the halfway mark between 4.8 and 12.7. <a href="#ref_jambeck">[Jambeck 2015]</a></p>

    <h5>Visualizing the amount of plastic in terms of shipping containers on a train:</h5>
    <p>To calculate the volume of 8 million MT of plastic, the density of compressed plastic was used. Values of thin and thick plastic bags, foamed polystyrene, and dense plastic stated in <a href="#epa_aus">[EPA Australia Waste Density]</a> were averaged to get 100 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The mass 8E6 MT = 8E9 kg of plastic would occupy 8E7 cubic meters, assuming a density of 100 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. A standard 40 foot shipping container (FEU) has an internal volume of 67.5 m<sup>3</sup> <a href="#ref_wiki_ship">[Shipping container standard dimensions, wikipedia]</a>. By dividing, one gets 1.2 million train cars required to contain the 8 million MT of plastic. To determine how long it would take for the whole train to pass, a speed of 30 mph/50kph was estimated based on YouTube video clips (such as the one embedded), corresponding to roughly one car passing per second. The total length of train and shipping containers is around 52360000 feet, or 9,900 miles. It would take 330 hours or nearly 14 days for this train to pass at 30 mph/50 kmph.</p>

    <h5>Cost of waste management on land vs. plastic removal from waterways:</h5>
    <p>We combined several data sources to determine the relative costs of removing plastic already released into waterways and preventing plastic from reaching waterways by proper waste treatment on land. 
        On-land waste disposal cost was calculated from <a href="#wb_ww_book">[World Bank What a Waste 2.0 2018]</a> page 102, Table 5.2.</p>

    <p>An approximate value of $160/MT for waste disposal globally was found by averaging the minimum value, $20 for collection + $0 for recycling in LICs, and the maximum value, $200 for collection + $100 for landfill in HICs.</p>
    <p>Harbor and near-coast cleanup costs were determined by looking at two successful devices in use for this purpose, <a href="#mr_trash_wheel">[Mr. Trash Wheel]</a> in the Baltimore inner harbor, and SeaBins deployed worldwide. Reasonably good information on cost and performance were available for these two projects. The cost of deployment of Mr. Trash Wheel is stated to be $700,000, with an annual operating cost of $100,000. Assuming a 10 year life cycle, that comes out to $1.7 million, or $170,000 per year. If it collects 700 MT over 4 years as stated, that is 175 MT/year, or $970/MT collected.</p>
    <p>The cost of deployment of a <a href="#seabin_project">[SeaBin Project]</a> v5 is estimated to be $4,000, plus $1,100 per year for operation. Over a 10 year lifecycle, that is a total cost of $15,000, or $1,500/year. Data from currently operational SeaBins shows collection of around 1.4 MT/year which gives a cost of $1070/MT collected. The SeaBin and Mr. Trash Wheel cost per MT are remarkably similar--by averaging them, we estimated that removing plastic from harbor or coastal waterways costs around $1020/MT.</p>
    <p>Significant open ocean cleanup has not been achieved at this point, so we used estimates from <a href="#ocean_cleanup">[The Ocean Cleanup]</a> project to calculate the approximate cost per ton. Because this technology has not been proven, these are only estimates. It is anticipated the device will cost between $4,000 and $6,000 (average of $5,000) per MT over a 10 year predicted lifecycle.</p>

    <h5>Ability to manage waste depends on income:</h5>
    <p>The classification of countries into high, upper middle, lower middle, and lower income by country GDP was obtained from the World Bank Country level dataset <a href="#wb_ww_db">[World Bank What a Waste Global Database]</a>. Because other datasets we were using did not separate out upper middle and lower middle income, we combined merged the two in this data set to form a ‘middle income’ classification. We created a world map color-coding countries based on their classification as UIC, MIC, or LIC to render the data relevant to our audience.</p>
    <p>The values of GNI currently used for these classifications was obtained from the World Bank as well [World Bank Classification by GNI 2019], and provided in the caption to give concrete values to those who are thinking about the map and subsequent data.</p>

    <h5>Average plastic waste per person per day</h5>
    <p>We combine the World Bank Country level dataset from <a href="#wb_ww_db">[World Bank What a Waste Global Database]</a> with the dataset from <a href="#ref_jambeck">[Jambeck 2015]</a>, and calculate a population-weighted average of plastic waste generated per person per day for each country for the GNI-based income groups (high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries).  We combine the upper middle income (UMC) and lower middle income (LMC) categories to maintain parity with the <a href="#wb_ww_book">[World Bank What a Waste 2.0 2018]</a> Table 5.1.</p>


    <h5>How much plastic waste is managed well globally?</h5>
    <p>We combine the World Bank Country level dataset from <a href="#wb_ww_db">[World Bank What a Waste Global Database]</a> with the dataset from <a href="#ref_jambeck">[Jambeck 2015]</a>, and calculate a population-weighted average of the percentage of inadequately managed plastic for the GNI-based income groups (high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries). We combine the upper middle income (UMC) and lower middle income (LMC) categories to maintain parity with the <a href="#wb_ww_book">[World Bank What a Waste 2.0 2018]</a> Table 5.1.</p>

    <h5>How much is spent on waste management?</h5>

    <p>We take these values from <a href="#wb_ww_book">[World Bank What a Waste 2.0 2018]</a> Table 5.1.</p>

    <h5>How far would a $1,000 investment go to clean up plastic waste?</h5>
    <p>The calculation of cost for open ocean ($5,000/MT) and near harbor ($1,000/MT) cleanup has already been discussed above. To determine how much would be cleaned up by a $1,000 investment, $1,000 was divided by the cost per MT for each of these. 0.2 MT would be cleaned up in the open ocean, and 1.0 MT in a harbor or coastal area.</p>
    <p>LIC, MIC, and HIC waste disposal costs were treated individually here. The average value for waste disposal was determined as discussed above, from <a href="#wb_ww_book">[World Bank What a Waste 2.0 2018]</a> table 5.2, page 104. For LICs, this average is $50, for MICs it is $105, and for HICs it is $210. As for cleanup, the amount of waste treated per $1,000 investment was determined by dividing $1,000 by the cost per MT.</p>
