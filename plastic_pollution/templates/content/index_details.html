        <h5>How much is 8 million metric tonnes?</h5>
        <p>8 million tonnes of plastic, compacted, would fill about 1.2 million freight train cars. If they were all linked together traveling 30 mph (about 50 km/h), it would take 14 days for all 8 million tonnes of plastic to pass.</p>
        <p>Plastic is not biodegradable, so once it’s in the ocean, it remains there.</p>

        <p>Once it enters waterways, plastic may be recaptured before it reaches the ocean. Two examples of automated devices which have been developed for doing this are Mr. Trash Wheel, located in the harbor in Baltimore, MD, USA, and the SeaBin project, located in waterways worldwide. Once plastic has entered the open ocean, currents and waves, as well as a greater overall area, make removal more difficult, so technology has not progressed as far. Under development now is a device by The Ocean Cleanup built to remove plastic from the open ocean.</p>

<br><br>
<div class="row">
    <p>In general, the cost of proper waste management prior to release into waterways is less than the cost of cleaning up plastic already in the ocean. Initial purchase and operation of Mr. Trash Wheel or an individual SeaBin corresponds to roughly USD $1,000 per ton of trash removed from the water. The Ocean Cleanup device is projected to cost around USD $5,000 per ton removed once it is operational. On the other hand, proper waste management to prevent plastic entering the waterways costs an average of USD $160/ton.</p>
    <p>However, the waste management cost on land varies widely based on where we are in the world. In fact, it’s not just the waste management cost -- but our plastic waste generation and our ability to manage the waste are strongly related to the economic condition of a country. Below we explore some of these variations.

As countries become wealthier, their consumption of many things, including single-use plastic, increases. With growing consumption of plastic, the amount discarded also goes up.</p>

        <p>As low- and middle- income countries get wealthier over time, we can anticipate their plastic waste production will increase. Plastic waste can be managed in one of three ways which effectively prevent its release into waterways and the environment in general--recycling, incineration, or landfilling. These three options all require a large investment in infrastructure which is not always available, meaning not all plastic waste in all locations is able to be managed well.

        <p>For simplicity we presented the average plastic waste per person per day by the country income cateogry. However, there is a wide variation within any particular income category. <a  data-toggle="modal" href="#exampleModal">Click here to see how plastic waste generation varies among a selected group of high-income countries.</a></p>

        <p>Most plastic waste from high income countries is well managed through one of these three options, while only about 32% of plastic waste from middle income, and 20% from low income countries is managed well. Poorly-managed waste can enter the world’s waterways, where it can enter the ocean or lead to environmental damage. While the highest plastic use per person occurs in high income countries, lower income countries have less developed infrastructure and smaller budgets, leading to more plastic which can be discharged into waterways.</p>

    <div class="col-md-5">
        <p>The expansion of plastic waste disposal has not been able to keep up with the expansion of production of plastic waste, which may be explained by a combination of the very low cost of plastic and the relatively high cost of effective waste disposal. Cities in low and middle income countries spend a much higher proportion of their municipal budget on waste disposal compared to those in high income countries, and improving waste disposal in lower income countries would require spending an even larger proportion of the local budget on waste disposal at the expense of other city programs.</p>
